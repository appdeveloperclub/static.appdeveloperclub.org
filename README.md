App Developer Club
==================

The App Developer Club is an organization of coders, designers, developers, and entrepreneurs, who simply love to build. This site is currently in development and will eventually feature a web app that would allow members within the club to create portfolios, interact with one another, and connect with industry mentors.

Prerequisites
-------------

- [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/downloads)
- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)

**Note:** There will be many more packages and plugins necessary to run the application. I suggest reading through which errors are raised when compiling either the web or mobile end and installing those necessary plugins into your computer. Note that you will probably need to install certain versions of python/rvm in order for some packages to work properly.


Getting Started
---------------

Get started by first cloning the repository:

```bash
# Get the latest version:
$ git clone https://github.com/appdeveloperclub/appdeveloperclub.com.git
$ cd appdeveloperclub.com

# In a separate terminal window, run:
$ mongod

# To finally run the web app:
$ npm install
$ node app.js
```

**Note:** I highly recommend installing [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon).
It watches for any changes in your  node.js app and automatically restarts the
server. Once installed, instead of `node app.js` use `nodemon app.js`. It will
save you a lot of time in the long run, because you won't need to manually
restart the server each time you make a small change in code. To install, run
`sudo npm install -g nodemon`.
